I just wanted to send you a message to thank you. I used Caspah to lighten a really blatant scar from the c-section I had after giving birth to my son. I applied it as I was directed to do by your customer service person that I emailed and am very impressed with my result. I know I asked a ton of questions before making my purchase, but I am very satisfied with the end result. I would recommend this cream to anyone looking to lighten a c-section scar.
